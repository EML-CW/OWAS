## Technology

This client is built using the ReactJS framework. I made use of various librairies to make things simpler. Let's not reinvent the wheel.

The librairies and NPM modules used are as follow:
- [Semantic-UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-ui) (NPM)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) (NPM)
- [React and all of its dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) (NPM)

## Philosophy

The main philosophy of this client is to be able to use it on any device as easily as possible.
This app is aimed at people that might not be tech savy so everything as to be clear and simple. As little view changes as possible, as little features as possible. Everything is there but at its place.<br/>
As users may not be tech savy, their devices might not be bleeding edge so the client must be as lightweight as possible. Even tho I use a UI Framework, it is not rich in animations and is pretty simple to render even for low end devices. <br/>
